# Old Games Archive
This is an archive of some old games I made. I lost the code for all of them. They are all zipped up executables of the actual games. You can download them all and play them if you want. They're not malware. Note that they're all Windows excecutables or Unity WebGL. No builds were made for macOS or Linux. You can try running them through Wine, if you want.
There is also a folder containing footage of a game named "Velocity" I made which you can't play because I never made a build of it. But I do have footage of it which I want to keep safe because it was my best work.
