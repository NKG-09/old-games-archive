# Old Games Archive
- This is an archive of some old games I made. Along with a few animations. I lost the code for all of the games. They are all zipped up executables of the actual games. You can download them all and play them if you want. **They're not malware.** Note that they're all **Windows executables or Unity WebGL**. No builds were made for macOS or Linux platforms. You can try running them through Wine, if you want.
- There is also a folder containing footage of a game named "Velocity" I made which you can't play because I never made a build of it. But I do have footage of it which I want to keep safe because it was my best work. I'm still trying to see if I can find an old build of the game.
  
> **Velocity and Unnamed first person puzzle game are my best works.**

## Overview of each game
### All is Chaos
- Date created: Aug 29, 2021
- This is a game I made for Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2. But I was too late to submit it. I recommend **turning down your volume** for this game. _It's very loud_. It's a weird 2D platformer, with really weird physics, really loud weird sounds, really weird enemies. It's a chaotic weird game in general.
### Block Breaking Simulator
- Date created: Nov 10, 2021
- This is a weird game I made for experimenting with AI. It's got a GUI, to mess with. You basically spawn many blocks, and you can spawn some robots that will find the block closest to it, go near it, and blow it up. It's a bit satisfying to watch the robots blow it all up. It also has _amazing_ music.
### Blok
- Date created: Feb 25, 2023
- This is a game I made to experiment and see if you can run **WebGL games through a web browser, on mobile**. So you play games on mobile without installing it. It's _barely functional_. It's nothing beyond an experiment. There is no gameplay or ANYTHING in this game. There's **nothing** in it.
### Crates: The Game
- Date created: May 02, 2021
- This was my **very first game**. It's a very basic concept: You pick up a block, place it on a black circle thing, to unlock the next level. The first level is _very_ hard. The physics and gameplay is very weird and extremely janky, very poorly coded and put together. The visuals are terrible. I made the second version's art myself. It was my first game, so I am quite proud of it.
### Flowcharts
- Date created: Aug 05, 2022
- I had a terrible idea of **creating software from game engines**. But this is that. This is a _"flowchart creator"_ made in Unity. It **barely works**, and I'm not explaining the controls of it because I want to keep this README small. But I will list out the keys used: **Arrows/WASD, Left-Shift, G, X, Left-click and drag, 2, 1, E, Enter**
### Fortastic
- Date created: Oct 04, 2022
- This is a game I made for an experiment to learn if you can make **"WebGL mobile games"**. It sort of works. The multiplayer might stop working eventually. It's NOT a functional game. Just a throwaway project. No gameplay really, just an experiment.
### FPS Game
- Date created: Feb 05, 2023
- This is a game I made for my experiments in making **WebGL mobile games**. This is an **FPS game**. It's just an experiment, not a game, and it barely works. Unfinished project.
### Kristalle
- Date created: Jul 09, 2023
- This is a game I made for fun with friends, to submit to the **GMTK Game Jam 2023**. And it is I'd say an okay game. It did have gameplay, and nice graphics, and sounds and everything. Most of all the assets were **made from scratch**. It didn't do _amazing_ in the game jam or anything, but it did _okay_. I had a fun time making it. I think this is one of the **last games I made**, before I stopped making games, and forgot most of the Unity I learned.
### Math Projects
- Date created: Jun 13, 2023
- This is an odd _"game"_ that I made. You put in a couple polynomials or something, and get it to **generate a curve** for you. It's very weird, with a very janky UI. I made it for fun.
### Square Root Spiral
- Date created: May 24, 2023
- This is an experimental creation, where I made a "game" that would _animate the creation of a square root spiral_. This **isn't** very janky, surprisingly. It is quite simple, and _quite satisfying_ to watch.
### terrible minecraft
- Date created: Aug 26, 2022
- This is just a **really bad** version of Minecraft I made in like, _a week_. It was made just for fun and practice. It is EXTREMELY janky and slow and doesn't work really. But you can try opening it if you are curious.
### Unnamed first person puzzle game
- Date created: Apr 23, 2023
- This is a **decent** game I made with some interesting mechanics and stuff, and some actual levels, a tutorial, and other stuff. It is _playable_, and probably one of my best works. It's still quite janky however. But you could say it's fun.
### Velocity
- Date created: May 13, 2023
- This is an FPS game I made over **a month or two**. I put a lot of work into it, and it was probably **my best work**. I made a lot of _art, particle effects, etc_ for the game. There were a lot of cool mechanics as well. Like a **dash, teleport, robots to blow up, etc, etc**. There were multiple levels and maps in the game. It absolutely was **my best work**, and all I have to show for it is a _few screen recordings_. I didn't upload any builds of it online, and I didn't have a backup. I am _still trying to find any sort of backup_ to get the game back again.
### Word Dungeon
- Date created: Sep 02, 2022
- This is a _"quiz maker application"_ that I wrote in C# with .NET. I made it for learning, really. It does **work**, but there's not much use to it. You **need .NET** to run it. You can use it if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it.
